about_content: |-
  I am a Psychology major at the University of California, Riverside, with a hospitality mindset and a growing focus on experiential coordination. Growing up between cultures and working bilingually in English and Chinese has made me especially sensitive to subtle cues in guest behavior, atmosphere, and communication. I enjoy designing experiences that feel warm, clear, and thoughtfully paced—whether it is a small multi-course dinner, a community event, or a concept proposal for a brand. I am preparing for early-career roles where I can keep learning how operations, service flow, and human behavior come together to shape memorable guest experiences.

          and service pacing all support Duolingo’s light, encouraging personality.

          Designed a corporate holiday event concept featuring a cohesive theme, run-of-show, guest-flow mapping, 
          and spatial layout. Integrated branded touchpoints across food, décor, and activities while balancing atmosphere,
          logistics, pacing, and basic sustainability considerations.

          A small-restaurant operations review connecting guest experience,
          FOH–BOH workflow, and service efficiency.
        description: |
          Conducted an operational analysis of a Japanese casual dining restaurant, assessing FOH–BOH coordination, 
          guest flow, and timing differences between hot and cold production lines. Identified key bottlenecks—including 
          pickup-area congestion and asynchronous dish pacing—and developed practical recommendations to improve workflow 
          efficiency, layout use, and overall guest experience consistency.

    layout: text
    content: |
      I’m drawn to spaces where people gather—the quiet moments before an event begins, the aroma that fills a room, the way light softens as conversation grows. I notice how details shape comfort, how a simple gesture can turn service into care. In those moments, I’m reminded why I love hospitality: it’s where thoughtfulness becomes experience.
