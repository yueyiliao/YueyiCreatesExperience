    layout: text
    content: |
      I’m drawn to spaces where people gather — the quiet moments before an event begins, the aroma that fills a room, the way light softens as conversation grows. I notice how details shape comfort, how a simple gesture can turn service into care.
      In those moments, I’m reminded why I love hospitality: it’s where thoughtfulness becomes experience.
