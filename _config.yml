about_content: |-
  **_Introduction_**
  - I am a senior at the **University of California, Riverside**, majoring in **Psychology**.
  - As an aspiring experiencial marketing/event coordinator/hospitality professional, I aim to integrate insights from human behavior with my passion for food, service, and event experience. My goal is to create thoughtful, refined, and memorable hospitality moments shaped by culture, craft, and genuine care.

  **_Experience and Growth_**
  - Hosted cultural and themed dinners for international students far from home, volunteered in community hospitality services, and organized pastry-making events supporting the local autism community.
  - Through these experiences, I have gained hands-on skills in food preparation, event coordination, and teamwork — and learned how hospitality brings people together through warmth, care, and thoughtful attention to detail.

  **_Work Ethic and Values_**
  - Reliable, calm under pressure, and attentive to every detail — whether serving guests, collaborating with a team, or preparing a dish.
  - Remain professional and composed in fast-paced environments, always striving to deliver comfort and care through genuine service.

  **_Professional Training_**
  - ServSafe Food Protection Manager, California Food Handling, and Responsible Beverage Service.
  - SHRM Essentials of Human Resources — teamwork, organizational communication, inclusive leadership.
  - Currently pursuing advanced training and preparing for an **internship (April–August 2026)** to gain practical experience in **hospitality operations** (event & banquet) and **kitchen management** (restaurants & bars).

  **_Career Vision_**
  - My long-term goal is to continue growing in the hospitality industry, developing my craft through lifelong learning, teamwork, and dedication to excellent service.
  - I aspire to create meaningful hospitality experiences that **celebrate culture**, **value sustainability**, **respect community**, and **foster human connection**.

    layout: text
    content: |
      I’m drawn to spaces where people gather — the quiet moments before an event begins, the aroma that fills a room, the way light softens as conversation grows. I notice how details shape comfort, how a simple gesture can turn service into care.
      In those moments, I’m reminded why I love hospitality: it’s where thoughtfulness becomes experience.
