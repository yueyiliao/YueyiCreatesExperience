about_content: |-
  I am a Psychology major at the University of California, Riverside, with a hospitality mindset and a growing focus 
  on experiential coordination. Growing up between cultures and working bilingually in English and Chinese has made 
  me especially sensitive to subtle cues in guest behavior, atmosphere, and communication. I enjoy designing experiences 
  that feel warm, clear, and thoughtfully paced—whether it is a small multi-course dinner, a community event, or a 
  concept proposal for a brand. I am preparing for early-career roles where I can keep learning how operations, service 
  flow, and human behavior come together to shape memorable guest experiences.

  I’m building toward early-career roles in experiential coordination, where I can bring together human behavior, 
  hospitality, and detailed event flow planning.

          Concepted a 40-guest branded holiday event where guest flow, playful activities,
          and service pacing all support Duolingo’s light, encouraging personality.

          Designed a corporate holiday event concept with a cohesive theme, run-of-show, guest-flow mapping, 
          and spatial layout. Integrated branded touchpoints across food, décor, and activities while balancing 
          atmosphere, logistics, pacing, and low-impact sustainability considerations.

          A small-restaurant operations review connecting guest experience,
          FOH–BOH workflow, and service efficiency.
        description: |
          Conducted an operational analysis of a Japanese casual dining restaurant, assessing FOH–BOH coordination, 
          guest flow, and timing differences between hot and cold production lines. Identified key bottlenecks—including 
          pickup-area congestion and asynchronous dish pacing—and developed practical recommendations to improve workflow 
          efficiency, layout use, and overall guest experience consistency.

    layout: text
    content: |
      I’m drawn to the moments when people gather—the atmosphere before an event begins, the shift in energy as conversation grows, 
      and the subtle details that shape comfort. With a background in psychology and hospitality, I pay close attention to how 
      environment, flow, and small gestures influence experience. That’s why I gravitate toward experiential work: it’s where 
      thoughtful design becomes connection.
